# Image Classification

## Overview
The Image Classification project focuses on classifying images into predefined categories using deep learning. This project leverages PyTorch for model development and employs state-of-the-art neural network architectures to achieve high accuracy.

## Features
- **Accurate Classification**: Utilizes advanced neural networks to classify images accurately.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing classification results.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Optimized for quick and efficient image classification.

## Technologies
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Model Architectures**: ResNet, VGG, or other CNN models
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV
- **Frontend**: React or Angular (if applicable)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Django (if applicable)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification.git
   cd image-classification
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Ensure your training images are stored in the `data/train` directory.
   - Ensure your validation images are stored in the `data/val` directory.

2. **Train the Model**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Pre-Trained Model
This project can leverage pre-trained models to improve classification performance. The pre-trained weights can be downloaded from [this link](#) and should be placed in the `models/` directory.
